itted version of the manuscript.  Instead, revise your manuscript and uploa=
d a new version through your Author Centre.

When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the=
 comments made by the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" i=

.


When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:

1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, =
tables (including captions) and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as you=
r "Main Document"
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF pref=
erred (either format should be produced directly from original creation pac=
kage), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submis=
sion.  Please ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, insti=
tution and telephone) in your user account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper.  You can=
 either include your data as electronic supplementary material or upload to=
 a repository and include the relevant doi within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no lin=
e numbers, vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files=
 will NOT be edited in production

Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Biology Letters and=
 I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at al=
l, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Best wishes

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed my concerns. I have but a few minor wording sugg=
estions

line 34: spelling: ccombines =3D combines

lines 44 - 52. I'd suggest rewording this a little bit as lines 48 - 52 are=
 a little awkward. May I suggest the following:


"We might expect the total evidence method to perform poorly when there is =
little overlap between coded anatomical characters in living and fossil tax=
a. This is because fossil taxa cannot be correctly placed within a clade of=
 living species if none of its members have been coded for morphological ch=
aracters. Furthermore, simulations show that fossils are more likely to be =
placed in clades with for which more characters have been coded, regardless=
 of whether this is the correct clade [8]."

line 152: ... a carnivoran fossil is unlikely to be placed in Herpestidae b=
ecause ....

line 159: I'd replace "It is worth noting" with "We acknowledge"

line 161: word order: provided easily accessible matrices

Comments to the Author(s)
The revisions to this paper get it closer to where it needs to be, and it r=
emains an important contribution. However, I don=E2=80=99t think the author=
s have gone far enough to respond to the reviewers=E2=80=99 main critiques.
The authors haven=E2=80=99t addressed Pete Wagner=E2=80=99s important comme=
nts about the use of the term =E2=80=9Ccladistics.=E2=80=9D Morphological c=
haracter data are not inherently cladistics, although they can be used for =
cladistics analysis, as well as Bayesian and likelihood approaches. They al=
so haven=E2=80=99t done anything to clarify that the relevant character set=
 for aligning fossil and modern data is skeletal characters. Many anatomica=
l characters do nothing at all for the incorporation of fossil taxa.
I=E2=80=99m also concerned that my original comments about the biases in ch=
aracter sets included still aren=E2=80=99t adequately addressed; they now a=
cknowledge that they didn=E2=80=99t include any character sets that weren=
=E2=80=99t available in print, but that doesn=E2=80=99t address what kind o=
f difference it would make to their results. I=E2=80=99m concerned it could=
 be a really important bias; morphological data was much more commonly publ=
ished for extant taxa in older phylogenetic analyses, and those are less li=
kely to be available digitally. You might be substantially underestimating =
the availability of these data, and if TE phylogenies aren=E2=80=99t includ=
ing them, I=E2=80=99m rather disappointed in the folks constructing them.=
=20
I don=E2=80=99t agree with the assertion that the genus level should be our=
 primary concern; more and more studies are building species-level trees wi=
th fossil taxa. I=E2=80=99m happy for the authors to discuss the patterns a=
t the genus level, because it is one of the important levels, but given tha=
t genera are an artificial line in the taxonomic sand, it=E2=80=99s certain=
ly not the primary one, and I=E2=80=99d hate to see this statement sail uno=
pposed into the literature. I=E2=80=99d like to see it moderated a bit in t=
he final version of the manuscript.
Also, one minor text edit I spotted:
Page 1, Line 34: =E2=80=9Cccombines=E2=80=9D should be =E2=80=9Ccombines=E2=
=80=9D

Comments to the Author(s)
I thought that the first draft of this manuscript was in pretty good shape,=
 but I think that the modifications in response to the reviewers (particula=
rly to points that Slater and Reviewer #1 raised that I somehow missed) rea=
lly make the paper much more tight than it was. =20

The new title is an improvement.  However, I think that it could be altered=
 still further: would something like: "Assessment of available anatomical c=
haracters for linking living mammals to fossil taxa in phylogenetic analyse=
s"?  That is the main thrust of the paper, after all, and it also avoids ha=
ving someone simply think: "Who cares? I have molecules" and moving on to t=
he next article. =20

Lines 159 - 160: "It is worth noting, however, that our analysis did not in=
clude all the matrices containing anatomical characters ever published."

One thing to note is that a lot of the older analyses, which tended to be m=
orphological, were done in the early days of modern phylogenetics, and thos=
e are the matrices that are most apt to not have pdf or html versions.  So,=
 there might be a bias against the "pioneering" studies.  However, many of =
those studies will be a quarter of a century old, and the homology concepts=
 and (especially!) coding protocols being used back then almost certainly d=
iffer from now.  Also, a lot of those matrices were "cleaned" to remove hom=
oplasy: this was not attempted fraud, but due to the fact that computer run=
s that are done in hours today took weeks and weeks back then, and actually=
 storing all of the trees that might come out of "messy" matrices was beyon=
d the old floppy drives.  That is one reason why I rarely use matrices publ=
ished before the early 1990's in my own meta-analyses.  So, if those matric=
es do exist and can be computerized, then I think that they should be viewe=
d as "starting points" for coding taxa: they almost certainly will need upd=
ating. =20

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have substantially revised their paper in response to both the =
three referees' and my own comments. All referees now seem to broadly agree=
 that the paper should be published, albeit with a number of further sugges=
tions for improvement. I urge the authors to consider all of these in their=
 final revision. In particular I agree with Referee 1 regarding the continu=
ed use of "cladistic" and the genus-level issue (many palaeontologists are =
now focused on the species-level and certainly many mammalian genera are no=
t monotypic - this is more of an issue with dinosaur workers), and Referee =
3 (Pete Wagner's) title suggestion is - I think - more likely to attract re=
aders.

One minor thing I also noticed is on L174 ("but also to any researcher focu=
sing understanding macroevolutionary patterns and processes"), this seems t=
o be missing an "on".
